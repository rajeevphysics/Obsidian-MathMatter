# Definition 
An absolute value is the distance a value is from the origin point on a number line. Mathematically, this is described as

$$
|x| =
\begin{cases}
x, & \text{if } x \geq 0 \\
-x, & \text{if } x < 0
\end{cases}
$$
Sometimes its easier to define this definition as $|x| = \pm x$

To solve limits analytically, knowledge of [[! Absolute Value Rules|absolute value rules]] are needed (example are also in that note).
