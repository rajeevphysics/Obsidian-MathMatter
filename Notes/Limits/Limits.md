# Definition
A limit tells you the value of a function as it **[[Epsilon-Delta Definition of a Limit|approaches]]** a certain point. In math, it is defined as the limit of a function ($f(x)$) as it approaches a point $n$

$$
\displaystyle\lim_{ x \to n } f(x)
$$

Limits can also have directions, and we denote them mathematically as:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\text{Limit as x approaches n  from the left} \\
\displaystyle \lim_{ x \to n^+ } f(x)\\
\\ \text{Limit x approaches n from the right} \\\displaystyle \lim_{ x \to n^-} f(x) 
\end{array}
$$

> [!note]
To solve limits analytically, knowledge of [[Analytical Limits Rules|analytical limit rules]] are needed.
