# Product Rule
The multiplication rule is a shortcut for absolute value functions in the form $|a|\cdot|b|$. This rule is true from the [[Proof of the Absolute Value Multiplication Rule|proof of the multiplication rule]].

$$
|a||b| = |ab|
$$

# Quotient Rule
The quotient rule is a shortcut for the absolute value function in the form $\frac{|a|}{|b|}$.

$$
\frac{|a|}{|b|} = |\frac{a}{b}|  \quad (b \neq 0)
$$

This solution is true because of the [[Proof of the Absolute Value Quotient Rule|proof of quotient rule]].

# Power Rule
The power rule is a shortcut for the absolute value function in the form $|x^n|$. This rule is true from the [[Proof of Absolute Value Power Rule|proof of power rule]]. Note that this rule only works for $nth$ power as an [[Integers|integer]].

$$
|a^n| = |a|^n \quad n \in \mathbb{Z^+} 
$$

# Triangle Inequality Rule
The triangle inequality is a shortcut for determining the difference between $a$ and $b$ and follows as

$$
|a+b| \leq |a|+|b|
$$

This is true from the [[Proof of the Absolute Value Triangle Inequality|proof of triangle inequality ]]


# Inequalities Rule
The inequalities rule is a shortcut for determining the solution for inequalities in the form $|x| \leq A$ or $|x|\geq A$. Where $A$ is a non-negative real number. The solution for both forms are as followed and are true from the [[Proof of the Absolute Inequalities Rule|proof of inequalities rule]].

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\text{If $|x| \leq A$ then:} \\
-A \leq x \leq A \\ \\
\text{If $|x| \geq A$ then:} \\ 
|x| \leq  -A \space \lor |x| \geq A
\end{array}
$$
