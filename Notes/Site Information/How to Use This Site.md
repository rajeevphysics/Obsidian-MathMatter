# How Notes Are Formatted
I'm guessing you are here to learn about some concept (that we hopefully have).
Each note is formatted to be short, derivation-focused, and explanation focused. 

The start of each note will include a summary if you need to quickly skim over a concept. On the right of each note, there is a section called "On This Note" that will have all the sections in the note; use this to skip to sections (computer only)

Some notes may have resources, which will mostly point to videos that I've watched to understand a concept. 

The focus of the notes is explaining concepts and showing assumptions we make throughout a derivation, or links to what it relates to

# Important Features For Computers

>[!tip] Are You Viewing This on a Phone?
If you are viewing this website on your phone, scroll down to or click [[How to Use This Site#Important Features For Phones|Important Features For Phones]]

Some tips and information in "Important Features For Computers" are not accessible to phone users.

Notes on this website are built in a way to **interlink ideas** with other notes. These are done in case you **forget or need to better understand a concept that links to another**.
You will know whether a word is linked if you see underlined text that links to another note. 

For example, this note can be linked back to [[Welcome to The Math & Matter Website]], notice that you **hover over linked text to quickly view its content** (which is computer exclusive)

On the [[Welcome to The Math & Matter Website|main menu]], all folders are sorted by classes, and index files, which hold the notes that belong to them. Click on the index files to view the notes that belong to that index file.

The **search bar** on the top left of the page allows you to search for specific keywords or note titles. For example, typing “website” will likely show you results for the "Welcome to The Math & Matter Website" first, alongside other notes that use the keyword “website”

**Another way** to **search** is opening the files on the left side of this site, which will always be visible and holds notes that relate to the folder topic. For example, this note is under “Site Information.” 

In the upper right of this page, you can see an **interactive graph** that shows you the current notes that connect to this page. Connected notes will only show by default if a note is directly referenced in another note (a note is linked)

You can use the **interactive graph** to **quickly swap** between **connected note**, or expand the graph (top right of the graph) to show all connected notes (This is fun to play around), or expand the current linked notes.

# Important Features For Phones
The website is built for both computers and phones; however, for a full experience of this website, I recommend using a computer as it makes navigation much easier.

On the phone, you are limited in the features at your disposal.

# Meaning of Highlighted Text
Most, if not all these notes will include some type of highlighted text. Below is the meaning behind most. I recommend you use this site in dark mode, since it makes highlighted text more prevalent

Any note titled summary is a quick overview of the main idea(s) expressed in the note, along with key equations derived or proved in the note

This dark blue text can also point to extra information in a note

>[!example] Examples
Some notes may include examples which will usually be under this type of colour

Now that you are done with this note, there are many ways to return to the homepage. The easiest is clicking the "Math & Matter" text on the top right of this website.
