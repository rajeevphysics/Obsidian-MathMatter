# Purpose
After finishing my first year of University, I realized that almost half of my first year content I didn't understand the core concepts.

I **could solve problems**, but **explaining** concepts to non-physics students, **I couldn't do well.**.

When I looked up content to help with my understanding of materials. Often, materials on the internet just say the information rather than explaining **why** or **how** behind it.

Then, when I started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I started making better notes since I wanted to make links to other notes, and thus subconsciously looking for ideas that linked to others.

I started understanding topics so much better since I could quickly skim over ideas to refresh my memory. If I forgot a topic that linked to an idea I was reviewing, it was much quicker to relearn that topic because of the links. Plus, the interactive view showed me notes that a topic related to or referenced from.

**I created this website to help** future students or self-learners learn topics with a **focus** on understanding **why** and **how** to **while being short and simple**. 

**I know** how **frustrating** it is to watch or read 10 minutes' worth of **precious time** to end up realizing that it **wasn't what you were looking for**, or didn't explain at all what you needed. That's why all my notes have a summary and have an estimated time to read to avoid this.

All my notes will usually use a link that references another note. I did this to allow people to quickly skim or review concepts that were needed to understand a topic they wanted to know. I wasted so much time realizing I needed to relearn some concepts and spend up to 20 minutes looking for the lecture notes or searching on Google.

My goal for this website is to teach users concepts by showing assumptions, references & examples while not wasting half your day.

# About Me
 My name is Rajeev, and I'm a Physics student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/). I started using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) during my second semester of my first year, after I noticed that I wasn't deeply understanding my course content. Obsidian helped me by visualizing the links between different types of content.

When I'm not on Obsidian or doing school work/related things, I enjoy running and playing the Piano. I like classical music the most, playing and listening to it, although I mostly listen to it when I'm doing work...
