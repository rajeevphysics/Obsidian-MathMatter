# Definition 
Natural numbers are a subset of [[Logic/Integers.md|integers]]. Natural numbers are numbers that are [[Logic/Integers.md|integers]] but are positive. Mathematically we describe natural numbers as
$$ 
\mathbb{N} = 0,1,2\dots
$$

Sometimes 0 is not included in natural numbers, but assume they are included unless specified.
