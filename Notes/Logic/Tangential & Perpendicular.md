# Definition 
Tangential and perpendicular are components of a [[Scalar & Vectors|vector]].

Tangential is the component of a vector pointing parallel to the vector. It can be imagined that the tangential component is moving in the direction the vector is pointing.

Perpendicular is the component of a vector pointing directly 90 degrees or is [[Orthogonality|orthogonal]] to the vector. It can be imagined that the perpendicular component is moving directly away from the vector.
