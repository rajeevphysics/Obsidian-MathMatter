# Definition
A scalar is something that does not have direction. It is just a measurement (has magnitude). For example, [[Energy|energy]] is a scalar because it is just a measurement. 

A vector is something that has direction. It is also a measurement (has a magnitude) but also direction. For example, applying a [[Forces|force]] on an object depends on how much you are pushing it (measurement) and the direction where you are pushing it (direction)

## Mathematical Rules 
To mathematically get vectors and scalars, this is a general rule for addition, multiplication and [[Dots Product & Angles|dot products]].

| Form          | Type                  | Outcome     |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ----------- |
| Multipication | Scalar x Vector       | Vector      |
| Mutipication  | Scalar x Scalar       | Scalar      |
| Additon       | Vector + Vector       | Vector      |
| Additon       | Vector + Scalar       | Not allowed |
| Dot Product   | Scalar $\cdot$ Vector | Vector      |
| Dot Product   | Scalar $\cdot$ Scalar | Scalar      |
| Norm          | Vector                | Scalar      |
| Norm          | Scalar                | Scalar      |

> [!note]
Addition of a vector and scalar is not allowed because they are fundamentally different quantity.
