# Definition 
Amps are the SI units of electric [[Current|current]], defined as the [[Coulomb|coulomb]] per second 

$$
A = \frac{C}{s}
$$

# Dimensional Analysis 
We define the coulombs per second as their own dimensional units as $I$ so:

$$
\begin{align*}
[A] &= \frac{[C]}{[S]} \\ 
&= [I]
\end{align*}

$$
