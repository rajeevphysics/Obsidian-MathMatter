# Definition 
A watt is defined as a [[Joule|joule]] per second.

$$
W=\frac{J}{s}
$$

# Dimensional Analysis 
> [!warning] Assumptions
Assume the standard quantity units for [[Dimensional Analysis|dimensional analysis]]
Also assume that the dimensional units of a [[Joule|joule]] is $\text{J}=[ML^2T^{-2}]$

$$
\begin{align*}
[W] &= \frac{[J]}{[s]} \\
&= \frac{[ML^2T^{-2}]}{[T]} \\ 
&= [ML^2 T^{-3}]
\end{align*}
$$
