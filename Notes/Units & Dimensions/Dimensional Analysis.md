# Definition 
Dimensional analysis is a way of justifying, deriving or proving an equation from the justification of the units (dimensions) of the quantities involved. We denote the dimension of an amount by the [].

This table is always true to determine the dimension of a quantity

| Quantity            | SI units      | Dimension Symbol |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| Length              | Meter (m)     | [L]              |
| Mass                | Kilogram (kg) | [M]              |
| Time                | Second (s)    | [T]              |
| Electric Current    | Ampere (A)    | [I]              |
| Tempature           | Kelvin (K)    | [Θ]              |
| Amount of substance | Mole (mol)    | [S]              |
| Luminous Intensity  | Candela (cd)  | [J]              |
## Examples
>[!example] Dimensions of Acceleration
From logical definition we know acceleration is the distance over time squared.
>
>$$a = \frac{d}{t^2} = \frac{[d]}{[t]^2}$$
Distance is the quantity of length, while time is the quantity of time therefore:
>
>$$
\frac{[d]}{[t]^2} = \frac{L}{T^2} = LT^{-2}
>$$

>[!example] Dimensions of Newtons Second Law
By [[Newton Laws|newton's second law]] $\Rightarrow F = ma$
>
>$$
[F] = [m][a] = [m] [\frac{d}{t^2}] = [M]\frac{[L]}{[T]^2}
>$$
