# Definition 
A coulomb is the SI unit of electric [[Charge|charge]]. It represents the amount of charge carried by about $6.24 \times 10^{18}$ electrons. It's described as the electric current per second.

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\text{1 C} = \text{current} \cdot \text{second } \\
\text{C}= A \cdot s
\end{array}
