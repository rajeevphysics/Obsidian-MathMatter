# Definition 
Triangles are similar if their side lengths are proportional or if all angles are the same. For example, looking at the image below, $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle EDF$ are similar because all their angles are identical. If their angles weren't identical but all the lengths were proportional to one another, they would also be similar.
