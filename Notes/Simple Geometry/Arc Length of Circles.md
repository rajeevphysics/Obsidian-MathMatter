# Definition 
The Arc lengths of a circle are the distances covered between two points on a circle. The distance covered is like following the lines of the circle between two points. Often, we describe arc lengths in terms of $\theta$ rather than the two positions 

## Derivation

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\text{To find the distance covered between two points on a circle} \\
\text{The total distance on a circle is the following where $2\pi =\theta$} \\
C = 2\pi r\quad (1)\\ \\
\text{Then the total  distance to cover on a circle is some another of $2\pi r$:} \\ 
C = k 2\pi \quad (2) \\
\\
(1) = (2) \quad \\
2\pi r = k 2\pi \\ 
r=k \\ 
\\
\text{So then the total distance covered can be stated as}\\
s=k\theta = r \theta
\end{array}
