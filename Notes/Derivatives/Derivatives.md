# Definition 
A derivative is the best constant approximation at a point in time. It measures how fast something is changing or the [[Instantaneous|instantaneous]] change.  Mathematically, this is the slope of a [[Tangent Lines|tangent line]].

$$
\frac{dy}{dx} =  f'(x) = \displaystyle \lim_{ h \to 0 } \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
$$

> [!note]
To solve derivatives analytically, knowledge of [[Derivative Rules|derivatives rules]] are needed (example are also in that note).
