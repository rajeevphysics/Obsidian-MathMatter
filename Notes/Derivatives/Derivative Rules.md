# Power Rule
The power rule is a shortcut for determining the [[Derivatives|derivative]] of a function in the form $x^n$. The derivative of a function in that form will follow:

$$
\frac{d}{dx }x^n = nx^{n-1}
$$

This shortcut is true and is shown in the [[Proof of Derivative Power Rule|proof of power rule]].

# Sum Rule
The sum rule is a shortcut for determining the [[Derivatives|derivative]] of a function in the form $f(x)+g(x)$. This shortcut is true from [[Proof of Derivative Sum Rule|proof of derivative sum rule]] and is as followed

$$
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)+g(x)] = \frac{d}{dx}f(x)+\frac{d}{dx}g(x)
$$
# Difference Rule
The difference rule is a shortcut for determine the derivative of a function in the form $f(x)-g(x)$. This rule is proven in [[Proof of Derivative Difference Rule|proof of difference rule]] and is as followed

$$
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)-g(x)] = \frac{d}{dx}f(x)-\frac{d}{dx}g(x)
$$

# Constant Multiple Rule
The constant multiple rule is a shortcut for determining the [[Derivatives|derivative]] of a function with a constant like $c\cdot F(x)$. The shortcut is true from the [[Proof of Derivative Constant Multiple Rule|proof of constant rule]].

$$
\frac{d}{dx}[C\cdot F(x)] = C\cdot F'(x)
$$

# Product Rule
The product rule is a shortcut for determining the [[Derivatives|derivative]] of a function in the form $f(x)g(x)$. This shortcut is true from the [[Proof of Derivative Product Rule|proof of product rule]].

$$
\frac{d}{dx}[f(x)\cdot g(x)] = f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x)
$$

# Chain Rule
The chain rule is a shortcut for determining the derivative of a function in the form $f(g(x))$. The following shortcut is true from the [[Proof of Derivative Chain Rule|proof of chain rule]].

$$
\frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x))\cdot g(x)
$$

# Quotient Rule
The quotient rule is a shortcut for determining the derivative of a function in the form $\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left[  \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}  \right] = \frac{f'(x)g(x)-f(x)g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2}
$$

This shortcut is true from [[Proof of Derivative Quotient Rule|proof of quotient rule]].
