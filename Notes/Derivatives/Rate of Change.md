# Definition 
The rate of change is a tool to tell you how quickly one quantity changes in response to another. In math and physics, our notion can be defined differently, but they all mean the same thing.
$$
\frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2}- x_{1}} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} 
$$

> [!note] Explanation
Example of rate of change showing the change in ($x_{2},y_{2}$) and ($x_{1},y_{1}$)

## Logical Justification 
The equation can argue why this equation is true from the graph above. To find  the change between $x_{2},y_{2}$ and $x_{1},y_{1}$, from the graph it can be seen that the change should be positive, and the change should be some number, since visually there is a change.

So the easiest way to determine that is to see the change in the y direction and the changes in the x direction. The magnitude of the change is each quantity divided by the other.
