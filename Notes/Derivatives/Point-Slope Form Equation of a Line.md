# Definition 
The point slope form equation of a line is a type of line equation that only uses the knowledge of one point and slope to create an equation of a line.

> [!note] Explanation
A line with two points and slope labelled. 

> [!warning] Assumptions
Recall that the [[Rate of Change|rate of change]] of a line is the change in the y-direction over the change in x-direction.
Assume we know the point  $(x_{1},y_{1})$ & the slope $m$ but we dont know the second point $(x_{2},y_{2})$

So, using the information from the image above, the slope would be:
$$
m = \frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2} -x_{1}}
$$

To create it in the form we want, we rearrange this equation:
$$
\begin{array}{c}
m(x_{2} -x_{1}) = \frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{\cancel{x_{2} -x_{1}}} (\cancel{x_{2} -x_{1}}) \\ \\
m(x_{2} -x_{1}) = y_{2}-y_{1} \\ \\
\text{We like this equation with change in y on the left} \\  \\
y_{2}-y_{1} = m(x_{2} -x_{1})

\end{array}

$$
