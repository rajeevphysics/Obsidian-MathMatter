# Definition 
Newton's laws are a set of experimentally proven results that describe classical forces. 

Newton's first law is "an object will continue in their motion unless a force acts on it." Which is true because in an [[Frames of References|inertial frame of reference]], if an object is moving at some velocity in a vacuum space, it will continue with the velocity unless acted on by a force.

Newton's second law is "The amount of force on an object can be described as $F=ma$."
This is a mathematical statement to describe the force an object has in relation to its mass and acceleration.

p = mv \\ 
\frac{dp}{dt} = m \frac{dv}{dt} \\ 
\underbrace{\frac{dp}{dt}}_{F} = ma \\  \\
F=ma
\end{array}

Newtons third law is  "If two objects interact they will exert the same amount of force on each other. " This is a statement that forces come in pairs that are exact opposite of one another ($F_{12} = -F_{21}$).
