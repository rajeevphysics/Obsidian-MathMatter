# Definition 
Center of mass in terms of acceleration describes the [[Acceleration|acceleration]] of a point as if all the mass were centred on a point. By definition of [[Acceleration|acceleration]] it's the [[Derivatives|derivative]] of the [[Center of Mass Velocity & Momentum|center of mass velocity]].

$$
\begin{align*}
a_{cm} &= \frac{dr}{dt} v_{cm} \\
&= \frac{\sum_{i}m_{i}a_{i}}{\sum_{i}m_{i}} 
\end{align*}
