# Definition 
The center of mass in terms of dynamics describes the [[External & Internal Forces|external forces]] as if all the mass were centred on a point. This describes the motion of the center of mass using [[Newton Laws|Newton's laws]].

## Derivation 
> [!warning] Assumptions
To derive an equation to describe the external forces on the center of mass, assume the following:
> - The [[Center of Mass Velocity & Momentum|velocity center of a mass]] in terms of [[Linear Momentum|momentum]] is $v_{cm} = \frac{p_{tot}}{M}\Rightarrow p_{tot}=v_{cm}M$
> - The [[Derivatives|derivative]] of [[Velocity|velocity]] is [[Acceleration|acceleration]]
> - The [[Derivatives|derivative]] of [[Linear Momentum|momentum]] is the [[Newton Laws|external force]]

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\frac{d}{dt} \left[ p_{tot}= v_{cm}M \right]  \\
\frac{dp}{dt}=\frac{dv}{dt}M \\
F_{ext}=a_{cm}M
\end{array}
$$
