# Definition
The conservation of momentum is a special case when the net [[Impulse|impulse]] is zero. This implies that no [[Newton Laws|external forces]] are acting on a body or a system. From the [[Impulse-Momentum Theorem|impulse momentum theorem]], because the net impulse is zero, the [[Linear Momentum|change in momentum]] is zero as well.

\text{If $I=0$} \Rightarrow \Delta p =0
