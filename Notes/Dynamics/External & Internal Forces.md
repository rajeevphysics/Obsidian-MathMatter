# Definition 
External and internal forces are forces that act on a system.

Internal forces are forces on a system that act on one another. They are [[Newton Laws|Newton's third law pairs]], so the sum of internal forces is always zero and doesn't change the motion of a system. 

External forces are forces outside a system, like gravity and friction. They don't come in Newton's third law pairs. They affect the system's motion.
