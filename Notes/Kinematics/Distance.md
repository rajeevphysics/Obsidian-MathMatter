# Definition 
Distance is the **total path travelled**. It's always a positive [[Scalar & Vectors|scalar]] quantity. Distance is never zero unless you don't move over time. Mathematically, distance is described as the total accumulated motion from a to b:

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\text{Distance (1D)} = |\Delta x| = |x_{2}-x_{1}| \\ \\ 
\text{Or as a form of velocity:} \\

\Delta x = \int_{a}^b |v(t)|dt
\end{array}
$$
