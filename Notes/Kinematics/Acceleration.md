# Definition 
Acceleration is the [[Rate of Change|rate of change]] of [[Velocity|velocity]] over time. It's a [[Scalar & Vectors|vector]] quantity that tells you how fast an object is speeding up, slowing down or changing direction. Mathematically, it's the [[Derivatives|derivative]] of [[Velocity|velocity]]. 

$$
\vec{a} = \frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}
$$

> [!note]
If acceleration and velocity are the same direction, the object is speeding up. If they are opposite to one another the object is slowing down. If the velocity is zero but the acceleration is in some direction the object is switching direction towards the direction of acceleration.
