# Definition 
Velocity is a [[Scalar & Vectors|vector]] quantity that tells you how fast and in what direction you are moving. It can be positive or negative. Velocity is the [[Rate of Change|rate of change]] of [[Displacement|displacement]]. Mathematically, it's the [[Displacement|displacement]] over time or the [[Derivatives|derivative]] of displacment.

$$
\text{Velocity}= \frac{\text{Displacment}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt}
$$
