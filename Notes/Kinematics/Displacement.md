# Definition
Displacement describes an object's motion over an interval. It's a vector quantity and can be positive or negative. Mathematically, displacement is described as a function $x(t)$ or described as the change over an interval

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\text{Displacment (1D)} = x(t_{2})-x(t_{1}) \\
 \\
\text{Or as a form as velocity:} \\
\vec{d} = \int_{a}^b \vec{v(t)}dt
\end{array}
$$
