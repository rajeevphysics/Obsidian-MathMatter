# Proving Vector Length & Angles Using Pythagorean Theorem

When proving vector length we will assume the Pythagorean theorem is true without a formal proof of it.

>We will also assume our plane in $\mathbb{R^2}$ as proof, which is also vaild for $\mathbb{R^n}$

Vector length is the length of the vector as described by its components. This is usfuel if we need to find angles under or above of vector.

If we have a vector in $\mathbb{R^2}$ such as $\vec{p}$ who is build for components $\vec{p} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix}$ then by Pythagorean theorem the length of $\vec{p}$ would have to be $$||\vec{p}|| = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2}$$

## Generalization
Using Pythagorean theorem notice that our length is just the vector in each plane so for a generalization the following must be true:
$$\begin{array}{c}
\text{If $\vec{p} = (x_1, x_2\dots dx_n)$ or $\vec{p} \in R^n$} \\ 
||\vec{p}|| = \sqrt{x_1^2 + x_2^2 \dots x_n^2}
\end{array}$$
