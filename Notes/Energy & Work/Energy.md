# Definition
Energy is always a conserved quantity. It tells you how much change a system is capable of making. Or the capacity to do [[Work|work]]. It's a scalar quantity measured in [[Joule|joules]]

Energy is described by the situation a system is in. For example, an object falling due to gravity will have [[Gravitational Potential energy|gravitational potential energy]]. Or pushing a box will have [[Kinetic Potential Energy & Work-Energy Theorem]].
