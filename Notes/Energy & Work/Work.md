# Definition
Work is a scalar and measures the amount of energy transferred when a force moves an object a distance. Mathematically, it's defined as the integral of [[Forces|force]] [[Dots Product & Angles|dotted]] with displacement. 

$$
\begin{array}{c}
W = \int_{a}^b \vec{F}\cdot \vec{dx}  \\
 \\
\text{If force is constant:} \\
W = \vec{F} \cdot \Delta x
\end{array}
$$

> [!note]
There is a [[Dots Product & Angles|dot product]] between the force and displacement because only the component in the direction of displacement contributes to the work done. 
> 
Physically, this makes. Imagine pushing a box at an upward angle, the force done upward won't contribute to pushing the box forward (in the direction of displacement)
