Nuclear binding energy is amount of energy needed to hold atomic structures together or to pull them aparat. Simple nuclear energy is from the protons and nutrons inside the nucleous.
# Assumption and Prior Knowledge
This note assumes you know this prior knowledge expressed in an example. 

For a particle like this: $$  _{Z}^{A}\textrm{C} $$
$A_0 = Z + N$
A (# nucleons)
Z (# Protons)
N (# Nuctrons)

So for this: $$ _{6}^{14}\textrm{C}$$
We can find some information about this particle assuming that
$$\begin{array}{c} R_0 = 1.2 F \quad \text{F = $10^{-15} m$} \\ 
u = 1.660538782(82) \times 10^-27 \\ 
m_p = 1.007276 u \\
m_n = 1.008665 u \\
V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 \approx \frac{4}{3}\pi R_0 ^3 A_0 \\
M = A_0\cdot u
\end{array}$$

## Density 
We can find the density of an this atom.

$$\begin{array}{c} 
\rho = \frac{M}{V} \\ 
= \frac{A_0\cdot u}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R_0 ^3 A_0}
\\ 
= \frac{u}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R_0 ^3} \\ 
\text{Plugging in value for R and u we get:} \\ 
\rho = 2.3 \times 10^{17}
\end{array} $$

# Nucleons Are Fermions
{Protons and neutrons both obey Pauli Exclusion Principle([[Fermion, Bosons & Pauli Exclusion Principle]]), but separately. They will form on different levels like below expressed through the Fermi gas model from [[Liquid Drop & Fermi Gas Model]]

The magnetic moment can also be noted from [[Magnetic Force#Magnet Moment]] and plugging in knows from we get the following.

$$\mu = \frac{e\hbar}{2m_p} = 5.05*10^-27$$
# Nuclear Binding Energy
>[!warning] Assumputions
To find the amount of energy needed to separate atomic structures into two, we are going to make the following assumption.

>$$E = \Delta m c^2u $$


So to find the amount of energy in this example:

>[!note] Explanation
Example of a Alpha decay process

$$\Delta m = (2m_H + 2m_N) -m_{HE} $$
So if we assume the following is true the equation give us that energy needed is the following:
$m_H = 1.007825u$ 
$m_n = 1.008665$ 
$m_{He} = 4.002603u$ 
$$E_B = 28.3 \space MeV $$
