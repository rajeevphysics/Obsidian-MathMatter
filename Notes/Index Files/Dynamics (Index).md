| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Conservation of Momentum]] | Principle stating that in an isolated system (no external forces), the total linear momentum remains constant          |
| [[Forces]]                   | Vector quantities representing interactions that change an objectâ€™s motion                                             |
| [[Frames of References]]     | Coordinate systems (inertial or non-inertial) from which an observer measures positions, velocities, and accelerations |
| [[Impulse]]                  | The integral of force over time producing a change in momentum                                                         |
| [[Impulse-Momentum Theorem]] | Statement that the impulse applied to an object equals its change in momentum                                          |
| [[Kinetic Friction]]         | Resistive force opposing relative motion of surfaces in contact                                                        |
| [[Linear Momentum]]          | Quantity of motion defined as the product of mass and velocity                                                         |
| [[Newton Laws]]              | Three experimenally derived laws                                                                                       |
| [[Static Friction]]          | Resistive force preventing motion                                                                                      |
