| [[Algebraic Proof]]                         | Proof using algebraic definitions                                |
| [[Combinatorial Proof]]                     | Proof using counting definitions                                 |
| [[Direct Proof]]                            | Showing a statement is true from definitions                     |
| [[Mathematical Induction]]                  | Prove by showing it holds for 1 and showing it its true for n    |
| [[Proof by Cases]]                          | Breaking a problem into different cases and proving each         |
| [[Proof by Contraposition]]                 | Showing a statements conclusion is false thus statement is false |
| [[Proof by Contradiction (Indirect Proof)]] | Assume the opposite and reach a contradiction                    |
