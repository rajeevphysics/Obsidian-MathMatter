# Definition 
An algebraic proof is a type of proof that relies on algebraic identities and manipulation (factoring, simplifying, [[Greatest Common Divisor (gcd)|greatest common divisors]], etc)to show that expressions are equal (Left hand side = Right hand side).

# Examples
> [!example] Show that  $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$
> 
> $$
\begin{align*}
(a+b)^2 &= (a+b)(a+b) \\  
&= a\cdot a +a\cdot b+b\cdot a + b\cdot b \\
&= a^2 + 2ab + b^2
\end{align*}
> $$
> 
Therefore, using algebraic proof, LS = RS

> [!example] Prove algebraically that the sum of two consecutive integers is always odd.
> 
> Let any integer be $n$
Two consecutive integers are $n + n+1$
The sum of these is $2n +1$
This is the identity of a [[Even & Odd Numbers|odd number]]
