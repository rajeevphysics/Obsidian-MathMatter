# General Principle
Rolling motion describes the motion of rolling object that exhibit two types of motion, translational and rolling. (eg. rolling ball)

If a object has rolling motion behaviour you should break up the statement into translational using [[Kinematics]] and rolling using [[Rotational Kinematics]] or [[Rotational Dynamics]]

>[!warning] Rotational Kinematics Only Applies to no slipping
Note that rolling kinematics can only be applied to rolling motion with no slipping.

>[!note] Explanation
Rolling motion is translation and rotational (Assume no slipping)

## Translational 
In the example above the object will have a v to the right, of the same length and at the top, middle and bottom because the whole object is moving to the right. The magnitude would be the same because the whole object is moving to the right together.

**Key equations:**
Because we use trranslation motion we use [[Kinematics]] equations
## Rotational 
In the example if you imagine a ball only rotating not moving. The middle will have some rotational speed (assume its rotating clockwise) so that $v = \omega R$ to satisfy [[Rotational Kinematics]]

If the middle is spinning clockwise with some velocity. Start from the **top** it will have a **velocity to the right**. 

At the **bottom** it will have a **velocity to the left**, since its spinning clockwise.

**Key equations:**
Because we use rotational motion we use [[Rotational Kinematics]] equations
## Rolling Dynamics 
In the first part of the example, if you combine the translation and rotational equations then you have a object that has both rotational and translational, or something that is experiencing [[Rotational Dynamics]] and [[Torque & Moment of Inertia]].

**Key equations:**
If we use rolling dynamics then we use [[Rotational Dynamics]] & [[Torque & Moment of Inertia]] equations

>[!bug] Important Note
For problem if you use a rolling dynamics analysis you can't use equations from rotational & translational. Visa-versa for the other way around.
