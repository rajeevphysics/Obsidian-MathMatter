When a body rotates like in [[Forces]] it can have rotational kinetic energy and work displaced on it like a linear body moving.
>
Key equations:
$K = \frac{1}{2}I\omega ^2$
$W = \Delta K$

# Rotational Kinetic Energy
Rotational kinetic energy is the kinetic energy created by a rotating body. 
This is different from kinetic energy created by [[Forces]]

If we assume a rotating body has kinematics energy in this way we derive an expression done blow.

>[!note] Explanation
Example of a rotating mass.

>[!warning] Assumption 
$v = r\omega$ from [[! Rotational Kinematics]]

$$\begin{array}{c}
K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \\ 
v = r\omega \\ 
K = \frac{1}{2}m(r\omega)^2 \\ 
K = \frac{1}{2}mr^2 \omega ^2 \\
K = \frac{1}{2}I\omega ^2 
\end{array}$$

## Example

>[!example] Finding V Example
![[Pasted image 20250517155349.png]]
Starts at rest, block falls through a distance x and rotates some angle. We can find V.
Assume $\omega = \frac{v}{R}$ because of [[! Rotational Kinematics]]
We are using energy from [[Work]]

>$$\begin{array}{c}
\Delta E = \Delta K +\Delta U \\ 
\Delta K = \frac{1}{2}m(v^2 - 0)+\frac{1}{2}I(\omega^2 -0) \\ 
\Delta U = mg(-\Delta x ) \\ 
\Delta E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 +\frac{1}{2} I\omega^2 - mg\Delta x \\ 
\omega = \frac{v}{R} \\
0 = \frac{1}{2}m(1+\frac{I}{mR^2})v^2 - g\Delta x \\ 
v = \sqrt{\frac{2g\Delta x}{1+\frac{I}{mR^2}}}
\end{array}$$

# Rotating Work
If a object rotates around a axis than the object then work must have been applied on that object in order for it to rotate.

We can derive an expression for rotating work done blow.

Example of work in a rotating body

>[!warning] Assumption
$F_\perp = \frac{\tau}{r}$
$ds = rd\theta$ 
> $d\theta = \omega dt$ 
>F above derived from [[! Moment of Inertia]] because we assume perp sin(1) = 1
ds  and $d\theta$ above is derived from [[! Rotational Kinematics]]

$$\begin{array}{c}
W = F_\perp ds \\ 
W = \tau d\theta \\ 
W  = \int \tau(\theta) d\theta \\ 
W = \int I \alpha d\theta \\ 
W = I\int_t ^ T \frac{d\omega}{dt} (\omega dt)  \\ 
W = I\int_t ^ T {d\omega} (\omega)  \\
W = \frac{1}{2}I(\omega _f^2-\omega_i ^2) \\ 
W = \Delta K
\end{array}$$

## Example

>[!example] Work V example 
Using the same example for a energy example, find V. Should get the same answer.

The only work done by the system is done by gravity.
$$W = mg\Delta x$$ So:
>$$\begin{array}{c}
W = \Delta K \\ 
\Delta K = \frac{1}{2}m(v^2-0) + \frac{1}{2}I (\omega ^2 - 0) \\ 
2mg\Delta x = mv^2 + I\omega ^2 \\ 
2mg\Delta x = mv^2 + I(\frac{v^2}{R^2}) \\ 
2mg\Delta x = mv^2(1+\frac{I}{mR^2}) \\ 
v = \sqrt{\frac{2g\Delta x}{1+\frac{I}{mR^2}}}
\end{array}$$
