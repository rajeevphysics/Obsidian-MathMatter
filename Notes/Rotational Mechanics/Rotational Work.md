# Rotating Work
Rotational work measures the [[Energy|energy]] transferred when a force moves an object rotationally. An object will only rotate when a [[Torque|torque]] is applied to it. So mathematically, rotational work is the integral of [[Torque|torque]] [[Dots Product & Angles|dotted]] with [[Angular Displacement|angular displacement]]. 

$$
W= \int_{a}^b \tau \cdot d\theta 
$$

> [!note]
There is a [[Dots Product & Angles|dot product]] between [[Torque|torque]] and [[Angular Displacement|angular displacement]] because only the [[Tangential & Perpendicular|perpendicular]] force contributes to rotational motion.

Using the same example for a energy example, find V. Should get the same answer.

Assume $\omega = \frac{v}{R}$ because of [[Rotational Kinematics]]

The only work done by the system is done by gravity.
$$W = mg\Delta x$$ So:
> $$\begin{array}{c}
W = \Delta K \\ 
\Delta K = \frac{1}{2}m(v^2-0) + \frac{1}{2}I (\omega ^2 - 0) \\ 
2mg\Delta x = mv^2 + I\omega ^2 \\ 
2mg\Delta x = mv^2 + I(\frac{v^2}{R^2}) \\ 
2mg\Delta x = mv^2(1+\frac{I}{mR^2}) \\ 
v = \sqrt{\frac{2g\Delta x}{1+\frac{I}{mR^2}}}
\end{array}$$
