# Definition 
The centripetal force is not a new force and describes how objects rotate in a circle. The centripetal force is a center-seeking force that forces the object to rotate in a circle. This force is only valid in [[Frames of References|inertial frame of references]]. Mathematically, this is described using [[Centripetal Acceleration|centripetal acceleration]] and [[Newton Laws|Newton's second law]]

$$
F_{c} = ma_{c} = \frac{mv^2}{r}
