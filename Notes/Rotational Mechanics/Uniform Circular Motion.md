# Definition 
Uniform circular motion is an object rotating at with constant [[Speed|linear speed.]] An object in uniform circular motion will also have constant [[Angular Speed|angular speed]]. The rotation around a circle is caused by the [[Centripetal Force|centripetal force]] and [[Centripetal Acceleration|centripetal acceleration]], which are always perpendicular to [[Velocity|linear velocity vector]].
