# Definition 
Angular speed is a [[Scalar & Vectors|scalar quantity]] and tells you how fast you are rotating around a circle. Mathematically, this is the [[Instantaneous|instantaneous change]] of [[Angular Displacement|angular displacement]]

$$
\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt}
$$

> [!note] If angular speed is always constant
If angular speed is always constant around a circle, then the angular speed can also be described as the time it takes to loop around a circle with circumference $2\pi r$ or

> $$
\omega = \frac{2\pi r}{T}
