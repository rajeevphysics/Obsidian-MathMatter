# Definition
Polarization is the effect of bringing a charged object near a neutral charged object. The charged object will attract opposite charges from the neutral object because of [[Coulomb's Law|Coulomb law]]. 

If the neutral object is light enough, the charges in the neutral object will force that object to move toward the charged object.

>[!warning]
> If the two objects dont touch one another, no charges will jump to the other object.
