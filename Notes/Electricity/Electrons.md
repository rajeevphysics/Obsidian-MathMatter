# Definition
Electrons are a fundamental property of nature, meaning there isn't anything that makes up an electron.

Electrons were discovered experimentally in the cathode ray tube experiment, which showed that negatively charged particles were deflected in electric and magnetic fields. He called them electrons.

| Basic Properties | Value for Electrons     |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| Symbol           | $e^-$                   |
| Charge           | $-1.6\times 10^{-19}C$  |
| Mass             | $9.11\times 10^{-31}kg$ |
