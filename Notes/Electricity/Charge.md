# Definition 
Charges are a fundamental property of nature, like mass. Meaning they cannot be created by smaller components or destroyed. We define charges as being positively charged or negatively charged.

Positively charged means there are more [[Protons|protons]] than [[Electrons|electrons]]
Negatively charged means there are more [[Electrons|electrons]] than [[Protons|protons]]

Like charged objects repel each other while oppositely charged objects attract one another.

| Charged Object 1 | Charged Object 2 | Interacction |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| Postive          | Postive          | Repel        |
| Postive          | Negative         | Attract      |
| Negative         | Postive          | Attract      |
| Negative         | Negative         | Repel        |
