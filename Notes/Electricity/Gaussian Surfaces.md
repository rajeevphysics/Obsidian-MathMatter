# Definition 
Gaussian surfaces are a type of imaginary closed surface used for [[Gauss's Law|Gauss's law]]. They are useful for the Gauss law as they act as a closed surface to calculate flux coming in or out of.

In Gauss' Law, when you pick a Gaussian surface, you integrate over the whole closed surface looking at the electric field at each point, or you make some symmetry argument and describe it as a 3D surface.

There are different types of imaginary surfaces; the choice depends on the symmetry of a problem. 

| Surface  | Best For                 | Symmetry    | Field Direction | E Constant?     | Example           |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ----------- | --------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Sphere   | Point/spherical charge   | Spherical   | Radial          | Yes             | Point charge      |
| Cylinder | Infinite line of charge  | Cylindrical | Radial for axis | Yes (side only) | Long charged wire |
| Disk     | Infinite plane of charge | Planar      | Perpendicular   | Yes             | Charged sheet     |
