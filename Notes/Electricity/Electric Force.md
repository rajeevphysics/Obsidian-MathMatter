# Definition
The electric force is the force experienced by a charged particle due to another charged particle or by an [[Electric Fields|electric field]]. 

The electric force can be defined in two ways, by [[Coulomb's Law|Coulomb's law]], where you define the force by a charged particle. Or by the electric field, where you define the force due to an electric field.

$$
\begin{array}{c}
\text{Coulomb's Law:} \\
\vec{F} = \frac{\vec{q_{1}} \vec{q_{2}}}{4\pi R^2 \epsilon _0} \\
 \\
\text{By the electric field:} \\
\vec{F}=q \vec{E}
\end{array}
$$

# Deriving The Electric Force 
>[!warning] Assumptions
Assume that a point charge will be in an electric field so that [[Forces]] are true 
> 
Also, assume the following:
> - The [[Electric Fields| electric field]] is defined as $F = q_1E$ 
> - From [[Coulomb's Law]] the electric force by a point charge is $E = \frac{q}{4\pi R^2 \epsilon _0}$

>[!note] Explanation
A point charge in an electric field.

$$\begin{array}{c}
\text{A point charge is in an electric field, the force on the point charge is equal to} \\ 
F = q_1E \\ 
\\
\text{From Coulombs Law we know:} \\ 
E = \frac{q_2}{4\pi R^2 \epsilon _0} \\ 
\\
\vec{F} = q(\frac{q_2}{4\pi R^2 \epsilon _0}) \\ 
\vec{F} = \frac{\vec{q_{1}} \vec{q_{2}}}{4\pi R^2 \epsilon _0} 
\end{array}$$
