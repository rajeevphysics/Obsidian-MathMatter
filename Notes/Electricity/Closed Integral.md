# Definition
A closed integral refers to a type of integral that starts and ends at the same point. We call this closed because we end where we started. Which is shown in the image below.

>[!note] Explanation
A closed integral will start and end at the same point. 

This is useful in areas like physics, such as [[Gauss's Law]] and [[Ampere Law]] that require starting and ending on the same point.
