# Definition 
Conservation of charges adds to the definition of [[Charge|charges]]. Conservation of charges is a statement that the total amount of charges in a [[! Closed system|closed system]] never changes. This definition is true due to experiments. Mathematically, it is saying that our total charges before and after must be the same.

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{Charge before} &= \text{charge after}\\
Q_{i} &= Q_{f}

\end{align*}

$$
> [!warning]
We can still create positive charges, just that creating positive charges forces a negative charge to be created as well
