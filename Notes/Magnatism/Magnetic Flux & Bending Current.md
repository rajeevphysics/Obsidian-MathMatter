# What is Magnetic Flux 
Magnetic flux is measurement for describing how much of something magnetic flows through something often imagery similar to [[Flux]]. 

$$\Phi _B = \oint B \cdot dA$$

>[!note] Explanation
The field lines are circular and outwards which is whats noticed in experiment 
# Bending Current 
If a magnet or charge is moved close to wire the charges tend to bend towards that outside object. This is caused by the lorentz force which explains how and where that force will be created ([[Magnetic Force#Lorentz Force]])
## How does this Happen
If we have a positive charge, and it moves with some velocity, and the current in the wire also moves with that same speed.

The electrons experience [[❓Length Contraction]] (although they are not moving near the speed of light) there are so many electrons and there attraction to protons are so strong the length contraction is notable.![[Screenshot 2025-06-07 at 2.38.31 AM.png]]
>[!note] Explanation
A positive charge outside the wire will force the positive charges to be pushed away from the positive charge outside the wire.

Because both the positive charge and the electrons are moving with the same speed. In the positive charge frame of reference there are more positive charges than negative charges because of [[❓Length Contraction]]. Because of [[Charges]] and the [[Electric Field]] the positive charge experience a push away from the positive charges.

>[!warning] Important 
Now if were stationary we say this is a magnetic field (but its actually a electric field just viewed in a different frame of reference)
