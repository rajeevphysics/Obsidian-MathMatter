# Definition 
The epsilon-delta definition of a [[Limits|limit]] is a more rigorous definition for approaching a value. It explains the mathematical reasoning for why the $\displaystyle\lim_{ x \to a } f(x)=L$ or when the approaching value converges to $L$

## Explanation
> [!warning] Assumptions 
The mathematical definition uses an epsilon-delta approach. To understand this, assume the following:
> - The definition of a limit that converges is $\displaystyle\lim_{ x \to a } f(x)=L$  

The definition of a convergent limit is that the limit close to $a$ is very similar to $L$ not matter the direction you approach it from. Mathematically it denoted by a vertical distance away from $L$ called $\varepsilon$. But this is taking into account the output of a function.

Remember that the limit approaches to $a$ so mathematically the horizontal distance away from c is called $\delta$. This takes into account out input to the function.

So the following requirements is made to prove that a function is convergent.
$$
\begin{array}{c}
\text{For any distance $\varepsilon >0$ there is a distance $\delta>0$ such that if:} \\ \\
0<|x-a|<\delta \quad (\text{There is a range of input values  that follow this rule}) \\
\\
\text{Then:}\\
|f(x)-L| < \varepsilon
\end{array}
$$
