# Definition
Linear combinations of [[Scalar & Vectors|vectors]] in linear algebra are when you multiply specific vectors by a scalar amount and [[Vectors, Vectors Addiction & Vector Multiplication|add them together]]. For example, consider the image below with two vectors in the $i$ and $j$ direction. If we added the two vectors together, the result would be a **linear combination** of the two vectors, being ${v=\begin{bmatrix} 1   \\ 1  \end{bmatrix}}$.

However, there are many possible results if we multiply any of these components by a scalar multiple of each vector, such that the linear combinations is as followed  $v = 3i{\begin{bmatrix} 0   \\ 1  \end{bmatrix}} + 2j{\begin{bmatrix} 1   \\ 0  \end{bmatrix}}$,
