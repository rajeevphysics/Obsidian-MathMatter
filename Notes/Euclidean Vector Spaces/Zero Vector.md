# Definition 
The zero vector is a vector whose components have a magnitude of 0. Physically, the zero vector is a vector at the origin. Mathematically, the zero vector is described as having the magnitude of 0 for each component in $\mathbb{R}^n$

$$
\vec{0}=\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\
\vdots \\
0
\end{bmatrix} \quad | \mathbb{R}^n
$$
