# Orthogonal Vectors 
In linear algebra, instead of stating a vector being perpendicular to another vector, we say those vectors are orthogonal to one another.

When we say vectors are orthogonal to one another, we often point to their [[Dots Product & Angles|dot product]] being 0.

$$
a\cdot b=0
$$
