# Vectors in 3D
Vectors in $\mathbb{R^3}$ are any set of vectors in the form $\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3\end{bmatrix} | x_1, x_2, x_3 \in \mathbb{R}$. A good way of thinking about vectors in $\mathbb{R^3}$ are that they have 3 [[Tangential & Perpendicular|perpendicular]] axes, where any point has a vector in all three axes. 


# Parallel lines in R3
>[!warning] Assumptions 
For this description assume the following graph depicts vectors in $\mathbb{R^3}$  in the x,y,z plane, but this is valid for any depiction of $\mathbb{R^3}$

>[!note] Explanation
A plane with a point P in $\mathbb{R^3}$ 

Using the graph above if we wanted to find all possible points to find parallel lines with point P like we did in [[Vectors Equations of a Line in 2D]].

**Notice how there are two ways a line could be parallel with point P.**

Our new definitions needs to take into account this possibility. 
## Derivation
>[!warning]  Assumptions
If we are looking for parallel lines with point P. This can happen with lines coming from the x and y-axis, but not z axis since these lines would be perpendicular. 
>
So we will assume the following:
$t, s$ are scalar multiples 

We will let all the possible parallel lines in the “x” and “y” be denoted by the following:
$$\begin{array}{c}
\vec{x} =t\vec{d} + s\vec{v} | s,t \in \mathbb{R}
\end{array}$$

Which would describes the plane at origin and like how we did in [[Vectors Equations of a Line in 2D]] to describes the plane parallel to point P we do the following:

$$\begin{array}{c}
\vec{x} = \vec{p} + t\vec{d} + s\vec{v} | s,t \in \mathbb{R}
\end{array}$$
