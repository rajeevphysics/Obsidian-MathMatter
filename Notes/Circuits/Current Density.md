# Definition 
Current density is the amount of [[Current|current]] per unit area. Sometimes, in defining current density, we assume the current in a general sense. Mathematically defined below as the number of charges per area, taking into account the [[Current#Drift Velocity|drift velocity]].

$$\vec{J}=\frac{I}{A}=\frac{qnv_{d}A}{A}=qnv_{d}$$
