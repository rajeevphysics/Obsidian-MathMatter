# Definition 
Potential difference, often called voltage, is a physical quantity that tells us how much energy per unit of charge is being transferred between two points. Mathematically, it's described as work done per charge

$$
\Delta V = \frac{W}{q}
$$

In circuits, when referring to voltage, we mean the potential difference between two points. For example, in [[Batteries|batteries]], the voltage is the potential difference between the two terminals of the battery.

We often define voltage or potential difference in circuits just as V, or volts.
