Current is the flow of electrons.

Current is created when a voltage is provided to a conductor. The electrons in the conductor get pushed. We call the conventional direct current the opposite direction of the flow of electrons.

Electrons don't move perfectly; they bump around other atoms. The average of these changes is called the drift velocity.

# Definition 
Current is the flow of electrons. In conventional direct current (DC) current is the opposite direction of the flow of electrons. Current is created when a [[Potential Difference|voltage]] is applied across a circuit. 

## How Does Current Make Electron Flow
> [!warning] Assumptions
Assume we have a battery attached to a copper wire in a closed circuit.

When a battery is connected to a copper wire (a [[Conductors|conductor]]), it creates a [[Potential Difference|potential difference]] between two points connected to the battery. The potential difference sets up an [[Electric Fields|electric field]] inside the wire. Which exerts an [[Electric Force|electric force]] on the free electrons in the wire. As a result, the electrons drift through the wire, creating current.
## Drift Velocity
Electrons in a current are not moving perfectly in the direction of an electric field. They bump into atoms, losing energy. Drift velocity is the average velocity electrons in a conductor will have. It's described as the distance electrons take over time.

$$
v_d = \frac{D}{t}
