# Resistivity 
Resistivity is how strongly a material reduces the flow of electrons. Materials that have resistivity properties are due to their insulating properties. Mathematically, resistivity is defined as the [[Electric Fields|electric field]] over [[Current Density|current denisty]]

$$\rho=\frac{\vec E}{J}$$

# Conductivity
Conductivity is how much a [[Current Density|easily charges]] can move through a material. Mathematically is defined as the inverse of the resistivity of the [[Current Density|current density]] over [[Electric Fields|electric field]].

$$\sigma = \frac{J}{\vec{E}}$$
