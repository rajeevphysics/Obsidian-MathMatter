A circuit is a closed loop that lets electricity flow. A circuit is composed of a source (e.g. battery) that gives voltage and a load (heat, resistors) that takes voltage.

# Definition 
A circuit is a closed loop that lets electricity flow. A circuit starts with some type of power supply that gives the circuit [[Potential Difference|voltage]], usually [[Batteries|batteries]]. Then, using [[Conductors|conductors]] or wires, there is some type of load that takes [[Potential Difference|voltage]], usually from [[Resistors|resistors]] or as heat. 

We know a circuit is closed if the [[Electrons|electrons]] from the power source complete a full loop and return to the source.

The type of circuits used most commonly is the ideal type of circuit. This assumes that the wires, unless stated, have no [[Resistance|resistance]].

Example of an ideal circuit with a wire. Notice that the only resistance is from the resistor.
