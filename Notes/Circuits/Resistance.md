# Resistance 
Resistance is commonly denoted as $R$ is the collision of electrons onto atoms, which causes the atom to vibrate. By the [[Conservation of Energy|conservation of energy]] atom release this vibrational energy as heat or sound. Almost any component in a [[Circuits|circuit]] produces resistance. 

$$
\text{Resistance $=R$}
$$
For example, [[Batteries|batteries]] have resistance, which is called internal resistance.  They are described mathematically as ideal output - internal resistance by [[Ohm's Law]]. Which is represented as the [[Potential Difference|potential difference]]

$$V_{ab}=\epsilon-IR_{int}$$
