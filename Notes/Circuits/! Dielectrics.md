# Definition 
A dielectric is a material used between [[Capacitors|capacitors]]. It's a material that reduces the [[Electric Fields|electric field]] and acts as an [[Insulators|insulator]].

>[!note] Explanation
When a material is inserted inside a capacitor, it reduces the electric field.

## How Do Dielectrics Affect a Capacitor
> [!warning] Assumptions
Assume the capacitor is in a running circuit with current and charges staying fixed

When a dielectric is inserted inside a capacitor, it reduces the electric field because of its [[Insulators|insulating]] properties and because of [[Electric Force#Polarization|polarization]]. Opposite [[Charge|charges]] arrange themselves to create another electric field opposite to the electric field created by the capacitor. 

In doing so, less voltage can move through, increasing capacitance. While the [[Charge|charge]] doesn't change.

$$\begin{array}{c}
V\downarrow = E\downarrow d \\ 
C\uparrow = \frac{Q}{V\downarrow}
\end{array}$$

# Deriving the Capacitance Dielectric Formula 
> [!warning] Assumptions
To derive the change in capacitance when a dielectric is inserted well assume the following:
> - Original [[Electric Fields|electric field]] between two plates are $E_{0} = \frac{V_{0}}{d}$
> - The [[Capacitance|capacitance]] of the plate is described as $C_{0}= \frac{\epsilon_0  A}{d}$
> - Dielectrics described as $\kappa$ 
>- When the dielectric is inserted in a [[Capacitors|capacitor]] the electric field is reduced; it can be described as $\vec{E}_{net}= \vec{E}_{0}-\vec{E}_{induced}$
