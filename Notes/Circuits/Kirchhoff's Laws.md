# Definition
Kirchhoff's laws are two principles that rely on the [[Conservation of Charge|conservation of charge]] and [[Conservation of Energy|conservation of energy]] in circuits. They are justified because they obey the two conventions.

## Current Law
The current law relies on the [[Conservation of Charge|conservation of charges]] in a circuit. Imagine a [[Junction|junction]] where multiple wires meet. If 2 [[Amps|amps]] (A) of current flow into a [[Junction|junction]], and 1 A flows out of one of the paths. Then the leftover 1 A must flow through the third path. Otherwise, it would violate the [[Conservation of Charge|conservation of charge]].

Mathematically, the total current in must equal our total current out of a junction.

$$\begin{array}{c}  
I_{before} = I_{after} \\
\text{Or} \\

\sum I_{in}=\sum I_{out}
\end{array}
$$

## Voltage Law
The voltage law relies on the [[Conservation of Energy|conservation of energy]] in a circuit. Imagine a charge moving our a circuit any energy gained must be used up when it reaches back at its starting point. Otherwise, this would imply that the charge creates or destroys energy. Which would violate the [[Conservation of Energy|conservation of energy]]

Mathematically this is saying any closed loop total [[Potential Difference|voltage]] must be zero.

$$
\sum V = 0
