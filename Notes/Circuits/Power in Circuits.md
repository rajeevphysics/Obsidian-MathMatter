# Definition 
[[Power]] in [[Circuits|circuits]] describes the change in the [[Electric Potential|electric potential]] over time. Mathematically, it's defined as the following:

> [!warning] Assumptions
To derive power in circuits, assume the following:
> - [[Power]] is defined as ($P=\frac{E}{t}=\frac{\Delta U}{t}$)
> - The electric potential is defined as $V=\frac{U}{q}$
> - [[Current|Current]] is defined as $I=\frac{q}{t}$

$$
\begin{align*}
P &= \frac{\Delta U}{t} \\
&= \frac{qV}{t} \\
&= IV
\end{align*}
